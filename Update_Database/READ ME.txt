UpdateCourseDatabase is a solution for Visual Studio 2017

At the moment, the only application it offers is to scrap SeaNet for courses offered only in the Fall 2018 
by writing the source HTML to a text file via Selenium. It then formats the courses and prints them to the console. This code
DOES NOT write to a database.

The attached text file entitled "Reference Code" has implmentated code to Read, Format, and Write 
course information to a database.


Additionally, Line 236 determines which semester to pull classes from.
Looks like... "dropDown.SelectByText("Fall 2018");"
